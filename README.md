CS50 Final Project

My goal for this project is to create a Flask App to controll inventory at my company. I have taken the basic template of the CS50 Finance problem set and sort of "Frankensteined" it to convert it into my own. I will be hosting this app on Heroku so I will be having to convert all the Database staments/hosting into SQLALchemy from the SQLite that was used in the original CS50 project. 

This project is still a work in progess.
