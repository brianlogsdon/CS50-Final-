CS50 Final Project

My goal for this project is to create a Flask App to controll inventory at my company.  I will be hosting this app on Heroku so I will be having to convert all the Database staments/hosting into SQLALchemy from the SQLite that was used in the original CS50 project. 

This project is still a work in progess.
